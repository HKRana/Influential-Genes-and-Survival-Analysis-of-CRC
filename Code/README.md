### This code is for the identification of influential genes, survival analysis, and validation

##
**Influential Genes and Survival Analysis:**
1. The file "Influential_Genes_and_Survival.R" is for the identification of influential genes and survival analysis of those genes
2. Two datasets are required to run the code: </br>
     I. [coadread_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_clinical_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ld7jrUADl9o7cMsZr9IjEVUZLZed1qIi) </br>
     II. [data_mrna_seq_v2_rsem_zscores_ref_all_samples.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ld7jrUADl9o7cMsZr9IjEVUZLZed1qIi)
3. The code will provide a list of influential genes with P value, Adj. P value and logFC
4. The code will also provide survival information and survival curves of the genes
##

**ROC Analysis of the Influential Genes and Model:**
1. The folder "Code for Validation" contains two files for the ROC analysis for the influential genes and model
2. The file "ROC of the IFGs.R" is for the ROC analysis of the influential genes
3. The file "ROC of the model.R" is for the ROC analysis of the model
